When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- in case I want to collaborate

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- local commits might not final in terms they are ready to share with others

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- i can work offline (e.g. compare branches)
